# Machine Learning

- Implementations of all the basic ML algorithms all by myself
- The algorithms were learnt from Andrew Ng's course of Machine Learning

### 1. Regression
- Implementation of Linear Regression
- There is only one single predicted Feature
- The decision Boundry is plotted using matplotlib

### 2. Classification

**KNN**
- Implementation of K Nearest Neighbors
- I classified the Breast Cancer Data from [UCI](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php)

**LR**   
- Implementation of Logistic Regression
- Decision Boundry is plotted using matplotlib
- Dataset used is made by myself

### 3.Neural Networks
- Implmentation of Simple Neural Networks(Non-Vectorized)
- I classified Iris dataset from [UCI](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php)

### 4. PCA
- Implementation of Principal Component Analysis
- Reduced the number of features from Iris Dataset

### 5. Anomaly Detection
- Implementation of Anomaly Detection

### 6. K-Means
- Implementation of K-Means, Clustering Algorithm
